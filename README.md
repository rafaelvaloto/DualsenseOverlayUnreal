The **DualSenseOnScreenOverlay** is a versatile and customizable widget for Unreal Engine, designed to seamlessly adapt to various screen sizes and resolutions.

It offers extensive compatibility with multiple DualSense controller models, providing flexible options to enhance integration and user interaction. 

This widget is ideal for developers looking to implement responsive and dynamic overlays with DualSense support directly within Unreal Engine projects.


> **Note:** No need to configure the buttons; they are already mapped to the default gamepad layout.
>
> You can also use the [ Windows Dualsense Unreal ](https://github.com/rafaelvaloto/WindowsDualsenseUnreal) plugin for Unreal for better compatibility
